## What's up!! ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Johnny Smith but you can just call me J. I am currently a student at UNC Charlotte as a Computer Science major. I am a former intern at Ally Financial.

I have a huge interest in AI and how the future of AI will interact with humans. That is why I am concentrating in Human-Computer interaction.
